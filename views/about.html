            <p>Established in 1974, the Cozy Cavern Bed & Breakfast has been a haven for travelers seeking a peaceful
                retreat by the sea. What started as a dream between two passionate individuals — Hank and Heidi Richmond
                — has blossomed into a charming sanctuary nestled in the heart of the San Juan Islands.

                <br><br>From the moment you step through our door, you'll feel the warmth and welcoming energy that Hank
                and Heidi have poured into this place over the years. Whether you're here for a quiet getaway or an
                adventurous escape, their dedication to creating a cozy, relaxing atmosphere is evident in every corner
                of the bed and breakfast. They've thought of every detail, ensuring that your stay is filled with
                comfort, tranquility, and moments of joy.

            <p>Our beloved Border Collie, Pickle, is the unofficial mascot of the Cozy Cavern. With his playful spirit
                and friendly demeanor, Pickle has greeted countless guests over the years. Whether he's lounging in the
                garden or running along the beach, Pickle brings a special charm to the Cozy Cavern experience. Guests
                often share fond stories of their encounters with Pickle — and some have even become lifelong friends
                with him. We encourage you to say hello to him during your stay; his wagging tail and warm personality
                will surely make your visit even more memorable.

                <br><br>At Cozy Cavern, we believe that every stay should be an experience worth remembering. From the
                stunning views of the coastline to the delicious home-cooked breakfasts, every moment is crafted with
                care and love. We want you to feel at home, whether you're unwinding with a book in our cozy living
                room, watching the sunset on the deck, or enjoying the tranquility of the island.

                <br><br>Join us at Cozy Cavern and let us share the beauty of the San Juan Islands with you. Hank,
                Heidi, and Pickle look forward to welcoming you and ensuring your stay is nothing short of magical. We
                can't wait to have you as part of our family!
